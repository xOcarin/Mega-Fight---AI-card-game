Mega Fight is a card game inspired by the game Superfight, a game where you argue about wacky hypothetical battles. <br>
The catch here, is the that all the cards are AI generated, and a depiction of the battle is also generated using the OpenAI api. <br>

This app uses Flask for its front-end, and python + the openAI api for its backend. <br>

# HOW TO PLAY:
Download the repo <br>
Open the apikey.txt file <br>
Replace the text in the file with your own openAI apikey <br>
(Tip: you can get an API key by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nafDyRsVnXU) <br>
Save and close the text file <br>
Open the "appfiles" folder <br>

Grab some friends and some drinkgs an have fun! <br>

# ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
You can get 5 dollars worth of free API credits if it is your first time using the API. <br>
